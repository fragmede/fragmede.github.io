<i>Dated from 2014. They trot it out every time something like this regularly happens. </i>

They do. The 2014 article about the UCSB/Isla Vista, CA shooting is the earliest I could find on their site; there's <a href="https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1820163660">a version</a> for yesterday's Sutherland Springs, TX shooting, but the fact that they barely need to update it - the latest says past eight years instead of the past five of the earlier article.

I mean, it's the Onion, it's satire, and it's as effectual as GOP's commitment to thoughts and prayers (and no more than that). I don't think they should change the headline, but I do wish they could stop publishing that article because we no longer have mass-shootings, and the way we start that is shifting the overton window to the left and fight to ban private gun ownership entirely. Guns for a well regulated militia <em>as the constitution says</em>, and no, Nicholas Nazi and his crazy friends are <em>not</em> a well regulated militia. If you must own guns, you <em>must</em> own at least 100 of them, and follow an onerous set of laws regulating their mere existence.

How about after a shooting local volunteers go around and people's emails and sign them up for a mailing list on how to support a repeal of the second-amendment.

Fine, maybe that's too headstrong a direction to start. How about we ban the sale of <em>ammo</em> to private parties who aren't going to use it on site? Meaning gun ranges can sell ammo for use on site, but no take-home ammo.o
