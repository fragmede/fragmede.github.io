The original, non-commerical promise of the Internet since the early days,
limited to academic purposes only, has been lost. I enjoy quite a number of
commercial usages; on-demand video, subscription music, various local delivery
services, etc, so commercial use *has* improved my life, however, there was a
hopeful utopian promise.


To the level of convenience
that I enjoy from commerical usage of the Internet, 

Secret backroom deals and corruption are rife in business; so common as to be
assumed in the physical world to the point of non-competitiveness. Say I want
to start a home improvement supply store. Well there's already Home Depot,
Lowes, and OSH, so unless I have a secret and exclusive source for free lumber,
I'd be crazy to even try, given all the deals that I assume Home Depot has with
all their suppliers, which guarantees it'll never die.

So? Is moving the world of non-digital collusion between big businesses to the
Internet the best we can achieve?

Strive for better. Stagnation is bad, tech or non-tech. Everyone's noticed how
Google searching's gotten less useful, or that Facebook (for the "olds" that
still use it) is more annoying than useful these days. The Internet should be
enabling better businesses by promoting competition, not stifling it.

Naive? Intentionally so.
Hopeful? In spades, not bought from Home Depot.
