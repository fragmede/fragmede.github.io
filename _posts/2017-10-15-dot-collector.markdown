[Ray Dalio's TED
talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/ray_dalio_how_to_build_a_company_where_the_best_ideas_win)
has gives a *fascinating* peek inside Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge
funds in the world. After showing video of himself being an arrogant bastard
early in his career which led to his ruin, he put his newfound humility to work
in his company's Dot Collector, to help himself, and others, continaully ask
themselves "how do I know my opinion is right?"

To attempt to remove opinions in the form of bias in reporting is a fool's
errand - facts *aren't* facts, they're unescapably framed by the other facts
around them, by the presentation, so a naive reporter can be made to report
anything, never mind a lazy report who merely regurgitates press releases.

What's so alluring about the program shown in the talk is that it's able to
propose moving past the simplistic one-person-one-vote stricture, and places
unequal value for a vote, depending on the voter. There are all sorts of ways
that could go wrong, but keeping to the grading system for hedge funds - are
they making money? - then Bridgewater is doing very well indeed.

Would this work on a broader audience? Bridgewater has the benefit of
indoctrinating its employees - by his own admission, 25-30% of employees just
don't make it, and those that do still take ~18 months to get used to that level
of honesty. This isn't the radical honesty tell-your-partner-they're-fat for
no good reason kind of hurtful "I'm just being honest" radicalism either. Mr.
Dalio is careful to point out that this is "only for the important stuff".

The brief glimpse into the dot collector in the form of a single screenshot
in the presentation shows there's a lot that Bridgewater must train employees
to be thinking along in order of this to be useful. There are broad descriptors
like "integrity" or "wise" that I can't see working out in a metatwitter,
free-for-all environment where no one can be trusted to read anything.

In a world where Twitter is a cesspool of death threats, and Reddit is only
better than 4chan if you willfully put on blinders, could this sort of
metamoderation, pioneered by Slashdot, and all but forgotten to the broader
public decades later, maybe this time around more advanced rating algorithms
could fight spam, as well as moderate to form a more sincere community, and
mitigate the baser human emotions of greed, envy and jealousy.
