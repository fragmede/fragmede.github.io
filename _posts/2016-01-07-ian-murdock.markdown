[Ian Murdoch](https://blog.docker.com/2015/12/ian-murdock/), founder of Debian passed away late last year. [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/the-birth-of-debian-in-the-words-of-ian-murdock-himself/) has a piece about Debian's creation.

Debian, or more specifically, apt, showed me how much easier computers could
be, as well as a real-world application that CS101 application stuff (package
version dependency resolution).
