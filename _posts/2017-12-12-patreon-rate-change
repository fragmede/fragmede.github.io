Patreon announced a “small fee-structure change” that turned into a big deal. They originally positioned it as a way to “get more money to creators” except that didn’t _really_ play out, so they updated the message to give slightly more technical reasoning.

Unfortunately, it seems like Patreon doesn’t understand that aggregation of charges to avoid CC fees is one of few reasons to actually use Patreon - a batch of ten $1 charges from me is worth far more than zero $10 charges. The batching is what lets me donate $1 usefully; those add up.

Of course, Patreon CEO Jack Conte **has** to realize this, but they still pushed on with this particular plan for some reason, and someone found [past statements](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/patreon-onboarding-growth) about preferring a fewer whale-sized patrons over a larger number of smaller patrons. It does make a certain amount of business sense, as it takes a lot more $1 charges than it does $100 to add up to “life-changing amounts of money” for a creator.

Patreon (currently) charges an unknown, variable amount of processing fee each month, documented as 2%-10%, meaning it’s not clear for a creator how much they’ll end up with at the end of the month.

If Patreon wants to fix something, fix *that*!

There may be few creators on the platform who will ever make “life-changing amounts” - or at least the kind that comes to mind when thinking about winning a multi-million dollar lottery. But for many, a dependable $1000/month, or even $300/month is life changing.
