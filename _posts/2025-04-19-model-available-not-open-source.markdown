### model available not open source*
 *  it's not open source if I can't see why the LLM won't tell me how to make cocaine.

Mark Zuckerberg wants to say Llama is open source. It’s not, don't let him. Open source is a long storied term that goes back to before the Internet. Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice of him to share the model file, I do appreciate it, with my home LLM setup. It’s just doesn’t deserve the Open Source moniker. I’m gonna be crass and put it this way. say I did something nice for you, and gave you a car. Would you be alright with me also claiming I fucked your partner/mom/sister? There’s no denying giving you a car’s a nice thing, but why am I saying that other thing?

The GPL dates back to 1989 with Richard Stalman and the Free Software Foundation, and represents truths and values that some people hold dear. The freedoms enshrined by that very first GPL license boil down to an ethos of copyleft, where sharing is caring. Derivative works must be available under the same license. Later versions addressed loopholes and technicalities, but the intent is for software to remain free.

What does that mean for us, 3 decades later, after the Internet's been built on the back of Open Source code? The thing about source code is that we can read it to see what the code is doing. When you’re trying to make a new username, and it won’t let you, it’s not because the computer hates you. It’s a computer, it doesn’t have feelings. It runs whatever code it was given. If the code looking at your username is just checking the length that your username is longer than 8 characters and denying it for that reason, that’s easy enough to comply with. If we can see the code, we can see that’s what it’s doing. If we can’t see the code, then maybe the writers of the software do hate you and have put your name on a list of people they don’t like and are being dicks.

So seeing the source is important. For something like GIM-Paint, we can go into the source at xxxx and see why it’s doing what it’s doing, and then if we don’t like, we can change it and build a different version that doesn’t do that instead. For LLMs it’s different. I have access to a supercomputer that could build Llama, given the full source to it, though not the privileges to do that, since it’s being used for something else by differently important teams. Most people don’t even have that access in the first place! Why I do want the source to Llama in the first place? I’m a curious guy, and learning about everything hits my dopamine button, but more than that, having the source to llama means I can see its alignment. I can see why it won’t tell me how to make cocaine, as if I'm really gonna become the next Pablo Escobar somehow with that information. I could see what other choices have been made for it. Why does it refuse to give me pipe bomb recipes but it’ll tell me my grandma’s favorite motive cocktail recipes? In the context of China, I’m grateful that the really smart people there were able to build on the model-available Llama from Mark and produce DeepSeek, but it won’t talk about Tiananmen Square. What else won’t it talk about? Covid?

That’s why the expression open source matters. If we aren’t given the source, then we don’t know what was used to make it. What other minefields are in there?
