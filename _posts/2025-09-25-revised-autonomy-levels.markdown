The current SAE levels for driving automation jump from "driver assistance" to "partial automation" to "conditional automation" without capturing the nuanced progression of capabilities that actually matter for safety and real-world deployment. Here's a more granular framework that better reflects the technical challenges and safety milestones in the journey toward full autonomy.

## Level 0: No Automation

Human does everything

## Level 1: Speed Control

Can maintain speed (cruise control)
Human controls steering and everything else

## Level 2: Speed + Steering

Can control speed AND steering simultaneously
Requires constant human supervision
Examples: lane keeping + adaptive cruise, highway autopilot

## Level 3: Highway/Simple Environment Mastery

Can handle all normal highway driving including lane changes
Can detect and avoid static obstacles (debris, stopped vehicles)
Cannot handle complex urban scenarios
Human takeover needed for construction zones, unclear markings

## Level 4: Basic Object Recognition & Avoidance

Can distinguish between harmless (plastic bag, leaves) and critical obstacles
Can perform emergency braking for sudden obstacles
Can navigate simple intersections and parking lots
Still struggles with edge cases and unpredictable actors

## Level 5: Predictive Behavior Modeling

Can identify and predict behavior of pedestrians, cyclists, children, animals
Understands social driving cues (hand waves, eye contact)
Can handle construction zones with human flaggers
Can navigate complex urban environments in good conditions

## Level 6: Defensive Rule Breaking

Can violate traffic laws when necessary for safety (mount curb, cross double yellow, run red light if being rear-ended)
Makes complex ethical decisions about least-harm outcomes
Understands when rule-breaking is the safest option

## Level 7: All-Weather, All-Condition Autonomy

Functions in severe weather (heavy snow, fog, torrential rain)
Can handle unmapped roads and areas
Matches or exceeds best human driver capabilities in all scenarios
