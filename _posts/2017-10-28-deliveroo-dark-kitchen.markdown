I went out for lunch in SF a few months back, and behind the
counter, the place was a madhouse, with frantic workers
fulfilling orders. However, there was only me eating there, with a few bike messengers and their giant backpacks.

Despite a seating area, the lunch rush was all large
deliveries to companies, so the seating area is just wasted
rent.

Following that direction some, the UK food delivery service
Deliveroo has taken over [the kitchen part
too](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/28/deliveroo-dark-kitchens-pop-up-feeding-the-city-londonhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/28/deliveroo-dark-kitchens-pop-up-feeding-the-city-london).
if Deliveroo is the brand that I'm buying from, and not an
actual Indian/Thai/whatever restaurant with a name I trust
and recognize, then Deliveroo might as well operate the
kitchen part as well.

Moving along past that, the interesting part for me then, is
going to be is if the other half of the restaurant experience
- the dining area manages to become a thing - sometimes I
want takeout so I can eat in the comfort of my own home, but
sometimes I actually want to eat out. Is there a new business
model enabled by this, for a fancy restaurant with no
kitchen? Order whatever food you wanted to the place, they
would take it, plate it as only a fancy restaurant can do,
and then serve it to you with the appropriate flourishes, on
a table with cloth tablecloth and fancy silverware. Finally,
they would take away the dishes (and clean them), but without
the cheapness of eating out of cardboard boxes.
